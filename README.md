## 🎯 Motivation

Cardiovascular diseases remain one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, claiming millions of lives annually. Early and accurate prediction of heart attacks can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely medical intervention and lifestyle modifications. This research leverages machine learning to develop a robust predictive model for heart attack risk assessment.

## 🔬 Methodology

### Dataset
- **Source:** [Specify dataset source, e.g., Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset, Framingham Heart Study, etc.]
- **Size:** [Number of samples and features]
- **Features:** Clinical parameters including age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, ECG results, and other cardiovascular risk factors

### Algorithm
- **Primary Model:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Rationale:** Random Forest was chosen for its:
  - Robustness to overfitting
  - Ability to handle mixed data types
  - Feature importance ranking capabilities
  - High predictive accuracy for medical datasets

### Experimental Setup
- **Train-Test Split:** [e.g., 80-20 or 70-30]
- **Cross-Validation:** [e.g., 10-fold cross-validation]
- **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC
