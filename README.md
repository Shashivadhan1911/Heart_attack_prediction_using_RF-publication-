Early and accurate prediction of heart attacks can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely medical intervention and lifestyle modifications. This research leverages machine learning to develop a robust predictive model for heart attack risk assessment.

## 🔬 Methodology

### Dataset
- **Source:** [Specify dataset source, e.g., Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset, Framingham Heart Study, etc.]
- **Size:** [Number of samples and features]
- **Features:** Clinical parameters including age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, ECG results, and other cardiovascular risk factors

### Algorithm
- **Primary Model:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Rationale:** Random Forest was chosen for its:
  - Robustness to overfitting
  - Ability to handle mixed data types
  - Feature importance ranking capabilities
  - High predictive accuracy for medical datasets

### Experimental Setup
- **Train-Test Split:** [e.g., 80-20 or 70-30]
- **Cross-Validation:** [e.g., 10-fold cross-validation]
- **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC
